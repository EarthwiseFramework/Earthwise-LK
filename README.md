# Earthwise-LK- The Earthwise Framework SDSS for the Little Karoo of South Africa

Note, this page was called Prototype-SA at one point, and the tool was originally called LandAdvisor.

This SDSS was written with ArcGIS 9.x, on Windows XP, so is unlikely to work in more recent versions of ArcGIS and Windows. As such, it may be best to consider the models and scripts herein as detailed documentation.
